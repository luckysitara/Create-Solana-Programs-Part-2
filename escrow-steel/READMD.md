### Steps to Create the Escrow Project

1. **Install Rust and Solana CLI**
   - Make sure you have Rust and Solana CLI installed on your machine. Follow the instructions at [Rust Installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Solana CLI Installation](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).

2. **Create a New Rust Project**
   ```bash
   cargo new escrow_project
   cd escrow_project
   ```

3. **Modify `Cargo.toml`**
   - Open the `Cargo.toml` file and add the following dependencies:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   steel = "0.1"  # Use the latest version

   [dev-dependencies]
   solana-program-test = "1.10"  # Use the latest version
   anchor-lang = "0.24"  # For compatibility if needed
   ```

4. **Create Required Files and Folders**
   - Create the necessary directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/tests
   touch src/lib.rs src/tests/escrow.rs requirements.txt README.md
   ```

5. **Implement Escrow Logic in `lib.rs`**
   - Write the logic for creating and releasing escrow accounts. (Refer to the provided `lib.rs` implementation in the previous response.)

6. **Implement Tests in `escrow.rs`**
   - Write the tests for your escrow logic. (Refer to the provided `escrow.rs` implementation in the previous response.)

7. **Add Content to `requirements.txt`**
   - Since Rust dependencies are managed in `Cargo.toml`, you can leave this empty or use it for any Python dependencies if needed.

8. **Write Instructions in `README.md`**
   - Provide detailed setup and usage instructions. (Refer to the provided `README.md` implementation in the previous response.)

9. **Build the Project**
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

10. **Run Tests**
    ```bash
    cargo test
    ```
